*xtype*, or Extended Type, is a dynamic type system library for Lua.

Sometimes, advanced type checking code is needed to implement specific abstractions; *xtype* aims to fill that need.

.Incentives:
Automation:: Prevent writing redundant type checking code.
Interoperability:: Having a general low-level type system library can ease the interactions of third-party code.
Metaprogramming / Genericity:: Exploit the dynamic nature of Lua to generate definitions on-the-fly.

See link:src[].
